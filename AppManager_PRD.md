# Product Requirements Document: AppManager

## Overview
**Product Name:** AppManager  
**Platform:** macOS  
**Technology:** Flutter  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** August 1, 2025  
**Author:** Marc Enzo

## Executive Summary
AppManager is a macOS application built with Flutter that helps users identify and manage unused applications on their system. The app scans the user's computer for installed applications, displays them in a sortable list with relevant metadata (including last launch date and size), and provides easy uninstallation options. This tool empowers users to reclaim disk space by identifying and removing applications they no longer use.

## Problem Statement
Many macOS users accumulate applications over time that they rarely or never use, which consume valuable disk space. The native macOS tools don't provide an intuitive way to identify these unused applications based on last launch date, making it difficult for users to decide which applications to remove.

## User Personas

### Primary Persona: Regular Mac User
- **Description:** Everyday Mac users who want to keep their systems optimized
- **Goals:** Free up disk space, maintain a clean system, easily identify unused apps
- **Pain Points:** Difficulty identifying which apps haven't been used recently, uncertainty about app sizes and impact on system storage

### Secondary Persona: Power User
- **Description:** Advanced Mac users who regularly install and test different applications
- **Goals:** Efficiently manage a large collection of applications, quickly identify and remove unnecessary applications
- **Pain Points:** Need more granular control over application management, require detailed metadata about applications

## User Stories

1. As a Mac user, I want to see a list of all installed applications on my system so I can understand what's taking up space.
2. As a Mac user, I want to sort applications by last launch date so I can identify which ones I haven't used recently.
3. As a Mac user, I want to sort applications by size so I can identify which unused apps are consuming the most space.
4. As a Mac user, I want to see the creation and modification dates of my applications so I can make informed decisions about keeping them.
5. As a Mac user, I want to easily uninstall applications I no longer need directly from the app interface.
6. As a Mac user, I want to see application icons to quickly recognize the apps in the list.

## Feature Requirements

  - Extract application icon
  - Extract application name and version

#### 3. Application Listing Interface
- **Description:** Display applications in a clean, intuitive list with relevant information
- **Requirements:**
  - Show application icon for visual identification
  - Display application name prominently

  - Support for responsive layout that adapts to window size
  - Implement smooth scrolling for large application lists
  - Include search functionality to filter applications by name

#### 4. Sorting and Filtering
- **Description:** Allow users to sort and filter applications based on various criteria
- **Requirements:**
  - Sort by last launch date (primary sorting method)
  - Sort by application size
  - Sort alphabetically by name
  - Sort by creation date
  - Sort by modification date
  - Filter by application type/category (optional enhancement)
  - Filter by time range (e.g., "not launched in last 6 months")

#### 5. Application Uninstallation
- **Description:** Provide functionality to safely remove unwanted applications
- **Requirements:**
  - Implement "Move to Trash" uninstallation option

- Intuitive controls for sorting and filtering

#### Application List View
- List entries with consistent height for uniform appearance
- Clear visual hierarchy emphasizing application name and icon
- Compact yet readable display of metadata
- Visual indicators for rarely used applications
- Size representation using both numerical value and visual indicator

#### Application Detail View
- Expanded view showing all available metadata for a selected application
- Preview of application icon in larger size
- File system location information
- Dependencies and related files information (optional enhancement)
- Historical launch frequency data (optional enhancement)

#### Uninstallation Interface
- Clear confirmation dialogs with application name and icon
- Option to move to trash (default) or permanently delete
- Progress indicator for larger applications
- Success/failure notification after uninstallation attempt

## Technical Requirements

### Platform Compatibility
- macOS 12.0 (Monterey) and later
- Support for both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs

### Development Framework
- Flutter for cross-platform development
- Dart programming language
- macOS-specific native code for system integration

### System Integration
- File system access for application discovery and metadata extraction

### Performance Requirements
- Fast initial scan (under 30 seconds for typical systems)
- Smooth scrolling performance with 1000+ applications
- Low memory footprint (under 200MB during normal operation)
- Background scanning option with minimal system impact

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Security
- Request only necessary permissions
- No collection of user application data
- Local-only operation (no cloud/server components)
- Secure handling of application metadata

### Privacy
- Clear privacy policy explaining data usage
- No analytics/telemetry without explicit opt-in
- No network access required for core functionality

### Accessibility
- Support for VoiceOver and screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support
